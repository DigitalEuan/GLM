# Summary of changes for run 1c2d31a1-2424-4b7b-bccf-398ccedefc0e
Everything you listed is done, checked by running it, and committed and pushed.

**1. The figures, regenerated.** `python -m glm_universal.figures --write` was re-run from `overlay/`. Every row of `overlay/FIGURES.md` came back unchanged except the collected test count, which moved 1,669 → **1,677** once the two new regression checks below were added. The whole suite was then run in full: **1,677 passed, 8,851 subtests, zero failures**.

**2. A changelog note about the theta template fix.** `overlay/README.md` gains row **5.1**, and its version header — which still read 4.9 while the change log had already reached 5.0 — is corrected to 5.1. The row records what the fix was and why it mattered: `report theta` claims six coefficients (`theta_series(order=5)` returns `[1, 0, 196560, 16773120, 398034000, 4629381120]`, and the solver puts all six into `expected`), but the column-3 template hand-wrote the keys `coeff_0` .. `coeff_4`, so the sixth was stated in column 2 and never re-derived in a fresh interpreter. The template now builds its `observed` map by enumerating whatever the series returns, and `report theta --verify-tct` returns `VERIFIED True` over all six. I also pinned it, since nothing was testing it: `test_runtime.py::TestReportThetaTemplate` (3 tests) checks that `expected` holds one key per returned coefficient, that the generated script enumerates rather than lists, and that a subprocess reproduces all six with no missing keys. All three fail if the old hand-written template is put back — I checked that by restoring it temporarily — so the regression cannot return silently.

**3. The session module's stale quantity count, confirmed and now verified.** `runtime/session.py` described its registers as `physics (660 quantities)`; it now says 726, which is what `len(session.register("physics"))` returns and what `FIGURES.md` reports under *Registers*. That was only asserted, not checked, so I added `test_figures.py::TestModuleDocstringsQuoteCurrentFigures` (5 tests): it reads the physics, chemistry and molecule counts out of the session docstring and out of `data_objects/physics.py`'s, compares each against the live register, and checks all six registers are named. Reverting the docstring to 660 makes it fail, which I verified.

**4. The documentation check before committing.** The counts quoted in `STATUS.md`, `MASTER_PLAN.md`, `CAPABILITY_ASSESSMENT.md`, `overlay/README.md` and the package and tests READMEs were brought to 1,677 tests / 8,851 subtests, the per-file rows for `test_runtime.py` (181 → 184) and `test_figures.py` (14 → 19) were updated with what they now cover, and `1,669 tests` / `8,818 subtests` were added to the superseded-phrase guard in `test_figures.py`. One genuine drift turned up beyond the test counts: `STATUS.md` said the Lean development was 26 files in two places while its own table and `FIGURES.md` said 27 — corrected. Historical change-log rows were left as they are, since they record what was true at the time.

**Re-verified alongside the docs:** `lake build` completes cleanly over the 27 Lean files with no `sorry` (the only `sorry`/`admit` matches in the tree are the English words "admitted"/"admits" in prose), and the repository and overlay copies of the Lean sources are identical; the end-to-end CLI evaluation is **83/83** (73 answered, 10 refused as expected, 0 unexpected refusals, 0 confidently wrong, 0 errored); benchmarks **2,389/2,390** with every suite above its baseline; **33 probes, 20 hold, 13 break, 0 errored**; all six example scripts run end to end; and `report analogies`, `report molecules`, `report chemistry coverage`, `report semantics` and `report theta` each return `VERIFIED True`. No behaviour changed in this round beyond the theta template already being fixed — the work was recording it, pinning both fixes with tests, and reconciling the numbers.

I finished the outstanding items rather than extending the project, and re-verified everything I state below by running it here.

**Verification pass (no code changed).**
- The whole Python suite was run: **1,324 tests, 6,331 subtests, zero failures**.
- The Lean 4 development (`RequestProject/GLM/`, 18 files) was rebuilt with `lake build` — a clean build — and re-checked for `sorry`: none, in either the main tree or the overlay's copy under `overlay/glm_lean/`, and the two copies are identical.
- All six example scripts under `overlay/glm_universal/examples/` run end to end.
- The CLI answers `report information loss`, `report infinite values`, `report capabilities`, `report semantics`, `meaning of water` and `relate energy torque`, all exit 0; `report semantics --verify-tct` returns `VERIFIED True`.
- The 33 capability probes were re-run: 19 hold, 14 break, 0 errored, 0 surprises.
- The semantic graph was rebuilt from scratch: 357 meanings, 1,705 notations, 6,210 binary and 6,649 ternary edges; the inherited-graph audit still reports 83 of 4,282 concepts grounded and 2 of 4,015 edges re-derivable.

**Gaps closed.**
1. **`MASTER_PLAN.md` was missing the semantics phase.** The meaning work was built, wired and tested, but the plan — which is the document that tracks what was built and how to see it recompute itself — never recorded it. Added **Phase 4 — meaning, not spelling**: the audit of the inherited concept graph with the function that recomputes each figure, the meaning space and grounded graph with their counts, the queries, and the Lean counterparts (`Meaning.lean`, `Grounding.lean`, theorem names checked to exist). Added the two missing rows (`report semantics`, `meaning of <term>` / `relate <a> <b>`) to the runtime-surface table.
2. **Stale figures from the last round.** The repository `README.md` and `MASTER_PLAN.md` quoted an earlier test count, and the repository README plus the overlay README still said the Lean development was seventeen files. All now say 1,324 tests and 18 files, matching the runs above; the reasoning README's pointer was likewise out of date and is corrected. Historical changelog rows were left as they are, since they record what was true at the time.
3. **`Transcendental.lean` was absent from the repository README's file listing** although it is part of the development; it is now listed.
4. Added a changelog row (overlay README 4.5 → 4.6) recording this reconciliation and the figures it was checked against.

Nothing in the Python package or the Lean development needed changing — the code was already complete and passing; the remaining work was in the documentation that describes it. All work is committed and pushed.


# Summary of changes for run 712f237d-e93d-4e44-92f7-e495abe022b0
Completed the four outstanding items. Everything below was checked by running it; the work is committed and pushed.

**1. The version bump, finished.** The package declared `glm_universal.__version__ = "1.1.0"` and exported the new `semantics` sub-package, but the test that pins the package surface still asserted `1.0.0` and listed only six sub-packages — so the suite was failing one test. `glm_universal/tests/test_wiring.py::TestPackageSurface` now pins the current version and all seven exported sub-packages (`substrate`, `data_objects`, `reasoning`, `semantics`, `runtime`, `migration`, `benchmarks`), which is what makes a future bump self-checking. The suite is now **1,094 tests, 6,331 subtests, zero failures** (about four minutes). Stale counts elsewhere in the package and reasoning READMEs were corrected to match.

**2. `glm_universal/tests/README.md`.** Repaired the file-by-file table (the `test_semantics.py` row had been left outside it, breaking the table), corrected the per-file and total counts against a real collection run, listed `test_semantics.py` among the substantive tests, and added a short section on the package-surface test and on the slowest fixtures.

**3. `glm_universal/examples/README.md`.** Rewritten. It now covers all six scripts — `reasoning_showcase.py` was missing entirely — plus the generated transcript and how to regenerate it, each script's flags, what each one prints when it succeeds, and its known limitations. Writing it truthfully turned up three real defects, which I fixed rather than documented around: `encoding_poc.py` and `scaled_carriers.py` looked for `data_objects/_data/elements_118.json` under `examples/` and could not start at all, and `scaled_carriers.py` formatted an exact `Fraction` with a float format spec, which raises on Python 3.11 — it now renders through the package's exact `decimal_str`, so no float is constructed. All six scripts run end to end; `demo_tct.py` reports `ALL DEMOS VERIFIED` and the showcase 29 probes, 29 as expected.

**4. The overlay top-level README.** Version 4.2 → 4.3, a changelog row for the v1.1.0 work, the README chain and the `glm_universal/` entry brought up to date (seven sub-packages, 15 query kinds, 16 report subjects, 1,094 tests, thirteen Lean files), and a new "GLM-3+ v1.1.0" section at the bottom: the audit of the inherited concept graph (83 of 4,282 concepts denote anything determinate; 2 of 4,015 edges state a re-derivable relation; the stored carriers put related pairs at mean Hamming 4547/376 and unrelated pairs at 12077/1009, either side of the 12 that two random 24-bit words average), the grounded graph that replaces it (357 meanings, 1,705 notations, 12,859 edges, all re-derived), the `meaning` query and `report semantics` subject, the Lean files, and the test count. Every figure in that section was recomputed here before being written, and `report semantics --verify-tct` returns `VERIFIED True`.

One consistency gap I closed along the way: the overlay's copy of the Lean development was missing `RequestProject/GLM/Semantics/Meaning.lean` and `Grounding.lean`. Both are now in the overlay and documented in its Lean README (eleven files → thirteen). `lake build` completes successfully and the development remains free of `sorry`.


# Summary of changes for run 49a39c3c-68b2-4fde-b6e9-f434bec3e479
Both halves of the request are complete, committed and pushed.

## 1. The GLM system implementation, completed

`glm_universal_v0.6.0/` is the supplied package, unpacked and finished.

- **`GLM.py` was missing from the archive.** The READMEs document it and two test files import it by path, so 30 CLI tests errored on collection. I wrote it from scratch against the behaviour those tests specify: batch mode (`-q`, `--query-file`, stdin) and `--interactive`; the flags `-d/--domain`, `-c/--columns`, `-f/--format`, `--list-domains`, `--export-trace`, `--check-script-exactness`, `--verify-tct`, `--no-banner`; the meta-commands `:help :domains :basis :columns :verify :history :snapshot :export :quit`; and the 0/1/2 exit-code contract.
- **New module `glm_universal/reasoning/information_loss.py`**, exported from the reasoning package and wired into the runtime as the query **`report information loss`** (aliases `report loss`, `report boundaries`), with a generated column-3 script that recomputes the whole study in a fresh interpreter and checks it key by key. Exact `Fraction` arithmetic throughout; no float is constructed anywhere. Views are memoised because the rational layer's `perceive` runs a Leech nearest-point decode, and the cache is tested to be an optimisation only.
- **Full suite: 652 tests, 5,877 subtests, zero failures** (610 before, plus 42 new in `test_information_loss.py`). Verified by running it, not by report.
- READMEs updated: `TopLevel_README.md` (v4.1 changelog + a full v0.7.0 section), the package, reasoning, runtime and tests READMEs, plus a new repository `README.md`.

## 2. The information-loss study

The write-up is **`INFORMATION_LOSS_STUDY.md`**. The formal development is in `RequestProject/GLM/` — six Lean files, building cleanly with no `sorry`, and the key theorems depend only on Lean's standard axioms.

Your idea, made precise: a layer is a *resolution*, not a set of claims. On that reading all three parts of it are theorems.

- **Loss and gain are the same event.** `boundary_nonempty_iff_new_visible`: the pairs a layer conflates are non-empty exactly when the layer above can state something it cannot.
- **Nothing true below becomes false above** (`Visible.mono`), so "becomes untrue" is located precisely — not in propositions flipping, but in an operation ceasing to be a function of what a layer sees (`descends_iff_congruent`, the exact content of the code's `can_multiply` flag).
- **The ascent is forced** by capacity below the carrier count, and computable: `escalate` returns the least layer separating two carriers, proved correct and minimal.
- **It continues without end** (`Tower.lean`): an explicit infinite ladder — layer *n* sees a rational to resolution 2⁻ⁿ — that is cumulative, gains strictly new expressive power at *every* step, has no final layer, and still eventually tells any two distinct carriers apart. Set against `boundary_above_rational_empty`, which shows a tower *can* terminate: whether it does is a property of the carriers, not of layering itself.

Four concrete boundaries are pinned exactly, not estimated: the layer stack over ℚ (resolutions 2/3/4, losses 2/1/0); addition, which is exactly right at the substrate on integer carriers and *ill-defined* there on rationals; the TAX conservation law, exact on bits and above them repairable only if `Y = 1/2`, which is false since `1/4 < Y < 1/2`; and Golay repair, unique at Hamming weight 3 and genuinely two-valued at 4.

## Audit finding

Running the same definitions against the shipped `dimension_layers.py` rather than an idealisation of it reports `refinement_chain_intact = False`. The substrate → integer step is **not** a refinement on real carriers: the substrate's 24-bit parity view separates a unit on coordinate 10 from the vacuum, while the integer layer reads only the seven SI7 exponents and conflates them — so escalating destroys a distinction the layer below already had. It is reported and tested rather than silently patched, since fixing it (widen the integer view, or narrow the substrate's) is a design decision about what the integer layer is for.
